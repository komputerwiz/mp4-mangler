    Video media permeates our lives: movies and shows for entertainment, tutorials or documentaries for education, security footage, scientific monitoring, video calls for work or keeping in touch, recordings of cherished memories, etc. We capture this data in video files using various cameras and smartphones, but unfortunately, these file formats can be brittle and prone to corruption. Imagine opening an irreplaceable video only to see an error message, ``Sorry, this file is damaged and cannot be played.'' What causes this to happen? How often does this happen? Which video files are at risk? This research answers these questions for the MP4 file format, the most commonly used format in commercial and consumer devices at the time of writing.
